                In IEEE RAS INSAT SBC, we aim to share our knowledge and
                expertise with our members. Our goal is to create a cohesive
                community fond of robotics, thatâ€™s able to share its proficiency
                and leave its footprint in this field. This was my childhood
                dream and by joining IEEE RAS INSAT SBC, I knew since the first
                days that I was in the right place and took my first steps to
                make my dream come true. When joining IEEE RAS chapter, you will
                have the opportunity to practice your technical skills and to
                implement your ideas into realistic projects.
